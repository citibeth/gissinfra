# Problems

## We're at GISS, data on discover
**Solution:** iPython (Jupyter) Notebooks
* iPython prompt as primary tool for data exploration/analysis.
* Replaces bash as user interface
* Everything in one consistent framework: no more Fortran + Perl + NCO + Python + bash scripting  

###Examples:

[IPyhton interact and widgets... (3-line ncview)](http://earthpy.org/pyncview_pm.html)
[Optimizing code for iso-surfaces...](
[Estimated likelihood of observing...]

Work: Two days to get Jupyter running on 
	discover in conformance with NASA security 
	regulations.
	
	

## Pre-process, post-process data files
**Solution:** Python + netCDF

* More flexible, less arcane than NCO
  - But not always faster to write
* Faster to write than Fortran
